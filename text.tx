Task 1: Project Setup
Create a new project directory (e.g., digital-bookshelf-api).
Initialize the project with npm init -y.
Install the required dependencies: express, mongoose, and dotenv.
Set up your file structure. It’s a good practice to separate your concerns. Create the following:
server.js: The main entry point for your application.
db/: A directory to hold your database connection logic.
models/: A directory for your Mongoose models.
routes/: A directory for your Express route definitions.
Create a .env file and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to it.
Create a .gitignore file and add node_modules/ and .env to it.

Task 2: Database Connection
In the db/ directory, create a connection.js file.
In this file, use mongoose.connect() to establish a connection to your database using the URI from your .env file. Export your connection logic.
In server.js, require and execute your database connection.

Task 3: Book Schema and Model
In the models/ directory, create a Book.js file.
Define a schema for a Book with the following fields and validation rules:
title: A String, which is required.
author: A String, which is required.
isbn: A String, which must be unique.
publishedDate: A Date.
inStock: A Boolean, with a default value of true.
Compile this schema into a model named Book and export it.

Task 4: API Routes
In the routes/ directory, create a bookRoutes.js file.
Use express.Router() to create a new router instance.
Implement the five core CRUD endpoints on this router:
Create: POST / - Creates a new book using the data in req.body.
Read All: GET / - Retrieves all books from the database.
Read One: GET /:id - Retrieves a single book by its _id.
Update: PUT /:id - Updates a book by its _id using the data in req.body.
Delete: DELETE /:id - Deletes a book by its _id.
Use async/await and try...catch blocks in all routes to handle errors.
Export the router.

Task 5: Server Configuration
In server.js:
Set up your Express application.
Use the express.json() middleware to parse request bodies.
Mount your book router at a base path, like /api/books.
Start the server on a specified port.
